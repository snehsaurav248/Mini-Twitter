# Mini Twitter

Mini Twitter is a lightweight social media application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create accounts, post tweets, follow other users, and view a real-time feed of tweets. This project demonstrates core features of a social platform and serves as a solid foundation for further development and customization.
